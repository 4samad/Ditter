### 1) What will the project do for the user?
A user can login to the app with a near wallet and post a deet (like a tweet) with an Image and that will get shared with other users who follow. Users can search and follow other users and see what they are deeting.

### 2) How are you using the features of NEAR Protocol?
The app will be a smart contract deployed on the NEAR and will make use of it's features like **Storage** for storing deets, **Context** while posting, **Persistent collections** for deets and users, and **Assert statements** when required.
